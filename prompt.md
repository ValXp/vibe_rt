Agent Instructions

Loop behavior
- Read `tasks.md` and `progress.md` and `learnings.md`.
- Work on the first task that is not yet completed.
- Append any findings (errors, gotchas, FYIs) to `learnings.md`.
- The project must build and all tests pass for a task to be considered complete.
- Upon task completion, make a commit of the changes you made and push them.
- Ensure all `.md` files are committed as well.
- Update `progress.md` after each run (done or blocked) with status, date and hour (local time), and commit message (no commit hash).
- If blocked (meaning you can't build/test or complete all the acceptance criteria) or if all tasks are done, create `stop.md` with a short reason and stop; the loop will end when `stop.md` exists.
